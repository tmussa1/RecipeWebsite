<h3>Ethiopia</h3>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>
    ¾ cup teff flour (found in health food shops)<br>
    3½ cups water<br>
    pinch of salt<br>
</p>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>Standing time 2 days<br>
    Mix teff with the water. Leave to stand in a covered bowl for a couple of days until it starts to bubble.<br>
    The mixture should be slightly sour and the consistency of crêpe batter. Stir in the salt.<br>
    Add a ladle of the mixture to a pre-heated skillet and cook slowly until air bubbles rise to the top.<br>
    Do not let it brown, and make sure that it is not too thick.<br></p>
